# Automate-2048-Game

* 2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down, left, or right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score by repeatedly sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over again. 

* This program will open the game at [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to automatically play the game.

* At the end it returns with your Score.
